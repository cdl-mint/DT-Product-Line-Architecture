## Requirements
- Java 8 JDK
- Maven 3.8 or higher

## How to build
- Execute `mvn clean install` in the respective project folder with a pom.xml 
- The language infrastructure generated by MontiCore can be found in the target folder of the language projects
- *NOTE* Since some projects depend on the `dt-template-lang` project, please build these projects before building the modules.

## Use the parser generated by [MontiCore](http://monticore.github.io/monticore/)
- The parser to process models of the respective languages can be found in the folder `\target\generated-sources\monticore\sourcecode\de\monticore\lang\<lang_name>\_parser` of each language project.
- The parser can be called from Java with a model of the respective modeling language as parameter.

## Folder structure
- The folders `modules` and `templates` contain all modules and templates including language and software component projects that were used in examples across our paper. 
- The folders with postfix `-lang` include the languages of our framework realizing the concepts of the presented metamodel. 
- The concepts of these language are defined on syntax level in the grammars located in the folder `src/main/java` of each project.
